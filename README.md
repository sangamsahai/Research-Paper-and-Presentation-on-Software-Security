Research Paper and Presentation on - " Threat Modeling Approaches for Requirements Specifications and Software Design "



This is a research paper on the topic "Threat Modeling Approaches for Requirements Specifications and Software Design "
This paper discusses a few strategies from all the classification of threat modelling approaches i.e.

1) Asset Based
2) Attacker Based
3) Software based

Then , this paper discusses about the challenges faced by software developers who do not have a sound knowledge 
of software security.

Lastly , in this paper , we propose a tool  STREAMS(Software Tool for Requirements Engineering Approach and Methodology Selection )
which can predict the best possible threat modelling approach based on some given input parameters.
This can greatly help all the software developers who are new to the feild of Software Security and Threat Modelling.
